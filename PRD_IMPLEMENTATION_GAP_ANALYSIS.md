- **User Interface:** Following established design patterns

---

## Recommendations

### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 1-2 weeks):**
1. **Focus on Inventory Transaction System** - This is the most critical gap
2. **Design Database Schema Extensions** - Plan all missing transaction tables  
3. **Create Inventory Engine Architecture** - Design auto-calculation system
4. **Prioritize Core Business Flows** - Receiving → Sales → Returns → Adjustments

### **SHORT-TERM GOALS (Next 1-2 months):**
1. **Complete Inventory Management System**
2. **Implement Customer Credit Management**  
3. **Add Receipt Generation System**
4. **Build Core Transaction Types**

### **LONG-TERM STRATEGY (3-6 months):**
1. **Add Advanced Reporting & Analytics**
2. **Implement Multi-Branch Support**
3. **Build User Management System**
4. **Add Business Intelligence Features**

## Conclusion

The current implementation represents a **solid foundation (15% complete)** with excellent UI/UX design and proper multi-unit support. However, there are **significant gaps in core business functionality**, particularly around:

1. **Inventory transaction management** (most critical)
2. **Customer credit system** (high business impact)  
3. **Comprehensive receipt system** (basic requirement)
4. **Reporting and analytics** (business intelligence)

**Immediate focus should be on implementing the inventory transaction framework** as this is fundamental to the business operations described in the PRD. Without proper inventory tracking through various transaction types, the system cannot fulfill its primary business purpose.

The **estimated timeline to achieve PRD compliance is 15-18 weeks** with a dedicated development team, or **6-8 weeks to reach minimum viable product** status for actual business use.
